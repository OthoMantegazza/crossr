Description: Functions that constitute a simple workflow for cross species transcriptomic
	comparison. The required input are expression matrix (we suggest to use TPM produced 
	with a pseudoaligner) and orthogroups (we suggest to use orthofinder) The function
	implement a simple linear model based workflow in order to select genes that behave
	differently among species.
