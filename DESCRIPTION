Description: Functions that constitute a simple workflow for cross species
    transcriptomic comparison. The required input are expression matrix, we
		suggest to use TPM produced with a pseudoaligner, and orthogroups, we
		suggest orthofinder for orthogroups inference. The package implements a
		simple linear model based workflow in order to select genes that behave
		differently among species.
